# Notes (Original by Calle Lepp√§joki)
"Sublime Text syntax highlighting for notes, todos, and lists. It's a super simple thing I just hacked together over a day - and it fulfills my needs nicely.

I use the standard syntax highlighting color scheme, so YMMV if you try it out and use another theme.
Check out Test for Notes.note to get a grasp of what it's for.

There's plenty of guides on how to build new syntax files.
I used these:

# Formatting Demo (by Victor Dalqvist)
This syntax highlighting (and associated demo) has the singular purpose of giving an easy way to view how any given formatting rule will look in your current colour scheme.

Simply install and compile the language (use one of the eminent guides above) and open the example file. Handy for use when building or modifying syntax highlighting schemes.

# Logs (by Victor Dalqvist)
Personal syntax highlighting scheme to make logfiles more easily readable - in particular, my own test logs. Example file included, but YMMV.
