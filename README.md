# SublimeNoteSyntax
Sublime Text syntax highlighting for my notes, todos, and lists. It's a super simple thing I just hacked together over a day - and it fulfills my needs nicely.

I use the standard syntax highlighting color scheme, so YMMV if you try it out and use another theme.
Check out Test for Notes.note to get a grasp of what it's for.

There's plenty of guides on how to build new syntax files.
